Dear Data enthusiasts,
Excited to share SQL Challenge related to the MALDIVES VS LAKSHADWEEP SQL ANALYSIS

Challenge overview:-challenge is to craft SQL queries to extract insights from the Maldives Vs Lakshadweep database.

Database Structure:
The Challenge revolved around four key tables within the database:
1)Destination
2)Tourist Attractions
3)Tourist Arrivals
4)Indian Tourists

Here, I present a segment of the insights derived from MALDIVES VS LAKSHADWEEP ANALYSIS Using MySQL key SQL Function and clauses utilized :
In this project, I made use of serval fundamental SQL function and clauses to derive meaningful insights ,
including:
1)joins in SQL : To combine data from multiple tables.
2)Limit clause :To retrieve a specified number of records .
3) where clause : To filter data based on specific conditions.
4)sum and count operations: For numerical calculations and counting
5) Order by clause: For sorting the data
6) Aggregate Function: To perform calculations on groups of data
7) Group by clause : To group data based on a common attribute
